ANSWERS:

Part 1 - theoretical questions:

1. One general use of Linux pid namespaces is to isolate the process ID number space, 
meaning that processes in different PID namespaces can have the same PID

2. Linux mount namespaces is being used to help isolate a process by allows each proccess to have a completely different view of the entire systemâ€™s mountpoint structure from the original one. 
This allows the isolated proccesses to have different root for each one, as well as other mountpoints that are specific to those processes. 

3. One general use of Linux cgroups is to limits, accounts, and isolates the resource usage of a collection of processes.

4. The use of the clone command is to creates a new process with some entry point.
The difference between them is which data structures are shared between the parent proccess and the child ans which not. 
For example, memory space, the table of file descriptors, and the table of signal handlers.

5. The chroot command changes the root directory for a running processes as well as its child processes.

6. The purpose of procfs is to present information about processes and other system information.
An example of its use is to interact with "/proc" contents as with regular files.
